<br /><b>St. Philip & St. James, Apostles & Martyrs</b>
<br /><i>“The birthday of the Apostles Philip and James. Philip, after having converted nearly all Scythia to the faith of Christ, went to Hierapolis, in Asia, where he was fastened to a cross, overwhelmed with stones, and thus terminated his life gloriously. James, who is also called the brother of our Lord, was the first bishop of Jerusalem. Being hurled down from a pinnacle of the temple, he had his legs broken, and being then struck on the head with a dyer’s staff, he expired, and was buried near the temple.”</i> (Based on the Roman Martyrology)

<br /><b><i>St. Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury</i></b>
<br /><i>“Born about A.D. 925, and was educated at Glastonbury Abbey, whither, after spending some time at the court of King Athelstan, he returned to become a monk. In his monastery he lived in great fervour, dividing his time between prayer, study and manual labour. Under King Edmund, he was appointed Abbot; but, having rebuked the unworthy King Edwy for his shameless life, was afterwards forced into a year’s exile in Flanders. Of Edgar the Peaceful he was a favourite and a chief adviser, and during his reign was made successively Bishop of Worcester (A.D. 957) and Archbishop of Canterbury (A.D. 961). Moreover, Pope John XII appointed Dunstan his Legate in England. The Saint never faltered in the execution of his duty, and did not spare even his Royal Patron, guilty at least on one occasion of flagrant immorality. By his ‘Canons’ Saint Dunstan did much to restore Ecclesiastical discipline in England, where his influence worked immense good. He expired calmly, May 19, A.D. 988, and was buried at Canterbury.”</i> (Based on the Ramsgate Book of Saints)

<br /><b><i>St. Augustine, First Archbishop of Canterbury</i></b>
<br /><i>“Saint Augustine shares with Saint Gregory the Great the title of Apostle of the English. Saint Gregory himself, before his advancement to the Papal See, set out to convert the English, but was recalled to Rome. Five years after his election to the Pontifical Chair, he sent forth a band of forty monks from the monastery of Saint Andrew in Rome, under their Prior Augustine, to begin a mission in England. They landed at or near Ebbsfleet in the Isle of Thanet, where they were received and listened to by King Saint Ethelbert, who received Baptism and established the holy missionaries at Canterbury (A.D. 597). Saint Gregory, on hearing of the success of the mission, sent the pallium to Augustine, together with a reinforcement of labourers. Saint Augustine died within a short time of Saint Gregory (A.D. 604). He was buried in the Abbey church without the walls of Canterbury, which he had founded.”</i> (Based on the Ramsgate Book of Saints)

<br /><b><i>Venerable Bede, Priest</i></b>
<br /><i>“Born A.D. 673. A Northumbrian educated at Jarrow, where he embraced the monastic life under Saint Benet Biscop, and was ordained priest by Saint John of Beverley. Well versed in the Latin and Greek languages, and for his time a fair poet, he has left prose works on the most varied subjects, ranging from clever expositions of the science of his day to noble commentaries on Holy Scripture. His Church History of the English has earned him the title of ‘Father of English History’. It is a plain unadorned chronicle; but that the author was thoroughly honest and most painstaking is evident to any reader. Bede was famous not only for his rare learning, but still more so for the holiness of his life. The account of his death (A.D. 735), which took place on Ascension Eve, written by one of his pupils, is touching in its loving simplicity. Bede’s last words were ‘Gloria Patri et Filio et Spiriti Sancto.’ His remains were enshrined in Durham Cathedral. Styled by Leland ‘the chiefest and brightest ornament of the English nation’.”</i> (Based on the Ramsgate Book of Saints)
