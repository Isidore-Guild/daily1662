<br /><b><i>St. Richard, Bishop of Chichester</i></b>
<br /><i>“Born the second son of Richard and Alice de Wyche about 1197 at Droitwich, Worcestershire; died 3 April 1253, at Dover. Studied at Oxford, Paris and Bologna. Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury, offered him the post of chancellor. Richard accepted the offer and thenceforward became his intimate friend and follower. In 1244 the Bishop of Chichester died; the election of Archdeacon Robert Passelewe to the vacant see, was quashed by Boniface at a synod of his suffragans, and on his recommendation the chapter elected Richard, their choice being immediately confirmed by the archbishop. Henry III was indignant, as Passelewe was a favourite, and he refused to surrender to Richard the temporalities of his see. Innocent IV consecrated him in person at Lyons, and sent him back to England. At length, in 1246, Henry was induced by the threats of the pope to deliver up the temporalities. Richard was solemnly canonized by Urban IV in 1262, and on 20 Feb. a papal licence for the translation of his relics to a new shrine was given; but the unsettled state of the country prevented this until 16 June, 1276, when the translation was performed by Archbishop Kilwardby in the presence of Edward I. This shrine, which stood in the feretory behind the high altar, was rifled and destroyed at the Reformation.”</i> (Based on the Catholic Encyclopedia)

<br /><b><i>St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan</i></b>
<br /><i>“One of the four great Fathers and Doctors of the Western Church. The death of the Archbishop of Milan, whose Diocese was torn in pieces by rival factions, necessitated the intervention of the Prefect to ensure an orderly election of a successor. It is said that in the midst of the tumult the voice of a child was heard crying out “Ambrose for Bishop,” and the cry, at once taken up by the multitude, was later endorsed by the Emperor Valentinian III. Ambrose, however, was as yet only a catechumen, preparing for Baptism. Nevertheless, all objections made by him were overruled. He was quickly baptised, confirmed, ordained priest, and consecrated Bishop (Dec. 7, A.D. 374). Divesting himself of all his wealth in favour of the Church and of the poor, he applied himself assiduously to his pastoral duties and to the study of the Holy Scriptures. His writings are voluminous, and in matters of religious doctrine still constantly appealed to. He died April 4, A.D. 397, and was buried by the side of the Martyrs Saints Gervase and Protase, whose relics he had enshrined at Milan.”</i> (Based on the Ramsgate Book of Saints)

<br /><b><i>St. Alphege, Archbishop of Canterbury</i></b>
<br /><i>“Born in 954; died a martyr in 1012. Left his widowed mother and patrimony for the monastery of Deerhurst (Gloucestershire). After some years as an anchorite at Bath, he there became abbot, and (19 October 984) was made Bishop of Winchester. In 994 Elphege administered confirmation to Olaf of Norway at Andover. In 1006, on becoming Archbishop of Canterbury, he went to Rome for the pallium. At this period England was much harassed by the Danes, who, towards the end of September 1011, having sacked and burned Canterbury, made Elphege a prisoner. On 19 April 1012, at Greenwich, his captors, drunk with wine, and enraged at ransom being refused, pelted Elphege with bones of oxen and stones, till one Thurm dispatched him with an axe. Elphege’s body, after resting eleven years in Saint Paul’s (London), was translated by King Canute to Canterbury. His principal feast is kept on the 19th of April; that of his translation on the 8th of June.”</i> (Based on the Catholic Encyclopedia)

<br /><i>“He was an officer in the army of Diocletian, the persecuting Emperor, and for refusing to sacrifice was tortured and beheaded at Nicomedia, a town of Asia Minor on an inlet of the Sea of Marmora (A.D. 303). Some say that Saint George was the young Christian who, as Eusebius relates, tore down the Imperial edict of persecution. The Greeks style him ‘the great Martyr’. The Crusaders gave great impetus to Western devotion to Saint George, though venerated in the West long before. From about the thirteenth century, he came to be regarded as Patron of England, partially displacing Saint Edward the Confessor.”</i> (Based on the Ramsgate Book of Saints)

<br /><b>St. Mark, Evangelist & Martyr.</b>
<br /><i>“The inspired writer of one of the Gospels. That he was of Jewish extraction may fairly be inferred from the fact that his writings abound in Hebraisms. Venerable Bede is of opinion that he was of the race of Aaron, that is, of the priestly caste. It is controverted whether he is the ‘John who is surnamed Mark’ (<scripRef>Acts 12:25</scripRef>) who was for some time the companion of Saul and Barnabas in the first part of their ministry. The Roman Martyrology, following the statements of several of the Fathers, styles him ‘the disciple and interpreter of Saint Peter,’ and adds that he wrote his Gospel at the request of the Roman Christians under the direction of Saint Peter himself. It seems almost certain that he is the disciple whom Saint Peter calls ‘my son Mark’ (<scripRef>1 Peter 13</scripRef>). Of his after-history we know that he was sent as a missionary probably to Aquileia, whence his connection with Venice, but certainly to Egypt, where he founded the great Church of Alexandria. It was there that Saint Mark suffered for Christ, dying in prison about A.D. 68. His body was in the ninth century translated to Venice, of which city Saint Mark is the chief Patron Saint.”</i> (Based on the Ramsgate Book of Saints)
