# The Kalendar with the Daily 1662 Lessons, enhanced


Enhanced Book of Common Prayer 1662 Daily Lectionary

This projects aims to construct an IMP file presenting the Book of Common Prayer's 1662 Lectionary. I chose that lectionary, since it does not crucially depend on moveable feasts. Descriptions of the Saints and Feasts are being added, sourced from Public Domain works. Note is made of the Octave of Christian Unity.

## Source for the readings
* [The Kalendar, with the Table of Lessons (1662)](http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/info/cal_1662/)

## Source for the descriptions

* Ramsgate Book of Saints and the Catholic Encyclopedia (Secondary sources, to be replaced by more antient material)
