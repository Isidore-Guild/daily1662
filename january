<br /><b>Circumcision of our Lord.</b>
<br /><i>“As Christ wished to fulfil the law and to show His descent according to the flesh from Abraham. He, though not bound by the law, was circumcised on the eighth day (<scripRef>Luke 2:21</scripRef>), and received the sublime name expressive of His office, Jesus, i.e. Saviour. In our own day the secular features of the opening of the New Year interfere with the religious observance of the Circumcision, and tend to make a mere holiday of that which should have the sacred character of a Holy Day. St. Augustine points out the difference between the pagan and the Christian manner of celebrating the day: pagan feasting and excesses were to be expiated by Christian fasting and prayer.”</i> (Based on the Catholic Encyclopedia)

In A.D. 353, elected Bishop of Poitiers. The Arian Emperor Constantius, taking umbrage at his powerful defense of orthodoxy, banished him to Phrygia in Asia Minor, where he continued to combat Arianism with so much success that to get rid of him the authorities suffered him to return to his Diocese in the fifth year of his exile. To the intense grief of his people, he was taken from them by death, January 13, A.D. 368 or 369.”</i> (Based on the Ramsgate Book of Saints)

There is a tradition that he instituted the four minor orders. Died a martyr (A.D. 250) at the beginning of the Decian persecution, and was buried in the Crypt of the Popes in the catacomb of St. Callistus, where in 1850 De Rossi discovered his Greek epitaph: ‘Fabian, bishop and martyr.’”</i> (Based on the Catholic Encyclopedia)

<br /><i>“Under the direction of Valerius, Bishop of Sargossa, Vincent made great progress in his studies. He was ordained deacon and commissioned to do the preaching in the diocese, the bishop having an impediment of speech. By order of the Governor Dacian he and his bishop were dragged in chains to Valencia and kept in prison for a long time. Then Valerius was banished, but Vincent was subjected to many cruel torments, the rack, the gridiron, and scourgings. He was again imprisoned, in a cell strewn with potsherds. He was next placed in a soft and luxurious bed, to shake his constancy, but here he expired (A.D. 304). His body was thrown to be devoured by vultures, but it was defended by a raven. Dacian had the body cast into the sea, but it came to shore and was buried by a pious widow. After peace was restored to the Church, a chapel was built over the remains outside the walls of Valencia. In 1175 the relics were brought to Lisbon; others claim that they came to Castres in 864. Honoured by the Greeks on 11 November.”</i> (Based on the Catholic Encyclopedia)
