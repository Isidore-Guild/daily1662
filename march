<br /><b><i>St. David, Archbishop of Menevia</i></b>
<br /><i>“Patron of Wales. The Breviary approved lessons describe him as born of noble parents in South Wales and educated by Saint Paulinus, the disciple of Saint Germanus of Auxerre. Later, he was a strenuous opposer of the Pelagian heresy. Appointed successor of Saint Dubritius, he transferred the chief Welsh Bishopric from Caerleon to Menevia. He is said to have been zealous for good discipline among both clergy and laity, and to have presided over the Synod of Brewi. The middle of the sixth century is rightly given as the time of his death, that of A.D. 601, adopted from the Annales Cambrenses being clearly impossible.”</i> (Based on the Ramsgate Book of Saints)

He governed for some years the monastery of Lestingay in Yorkshire, acquiring thereby a great reputation for ability and for holiness of life. Through a mistake occasioned by the prolonged absence of Saint Wilfrid in France, Saint Chad was consecrated Archbishop of York in his place; but on the Saint’s return passed to the Bishopric of the Mercians, of which he fixed the See at Lichfield. He died two years later in the great pestilence of A.D. 673, leaving an imperishable memory for zeal and devotedness.”</i> (Based on the Ramsgate Book of Saints)

<br /><i>“Suffered at Carthage, 7 March 203, together with Saint Felicitas and three companions. The details of the martyrdom of these five confessors in the North African Church have reached us through a genuine, contemporary description, one of the most affecting accounts of the glorious warfare of Christian martyrdom in ancient times. Five catechumens at Carthage were seized and cast into prison, viz. Vibia Perpetua, a young married lady of noble birth; the slave Felicitas, and three others. After their arrest, and before they were led away to prison, the five catechumens were baptized. All was faithfully committed to writing by Perpetua, and shortly after the death of the martyrs another Christian added to this document an account of their execution.”</i> (Based on the Catholic Encyclopedia)

<br /><b><i>St. Gregory the Great, Bishop of Rome & Confessor</i></b>
<br /><i>“Born in Rome, A.D. 540, he relinquished his prospects of a brilliant future in the world by retiring to a monastery. At the death of Pelagius (A.D. 590), Gregory, after vainly trying by flight to avoid the dignity, was elected his successor. During his thirteen years of Pontificate, his untiring energy (despite continuous ill-health) enabled him to accomplish a very thorough Reform of Church discipline. His work in Liturgy and Church music has proved lasting. He dealt successfully with the yet existing debris of the old heresies. His sending of Saint Augustine with his forty monks, as first missionaries to the Anglo-Saxons, has earned him the title of Apostle of England. He saved Rome from oppression by the Lombards, who at that time were devastating Italy. He rested from his labours, March 12, A.D. 604, and was buried in Saint Peter’s Basilica.”</i> (Based on the Ramsgate Book of Saints)

He was murdered at Wareham in Dorsetshire by emissaries, hired by his jealous and ambitious stepmother, March 18, A.D. 978; and was forthwith popularly acclaimed as a Martyr. His remains were translated to Shaftesbury three years after his death.”</i> (Based on the Ramsgate Book of Saints)

<br /><b><i>St. Benedict, Abbot</i></b>
<br /><i>“The Patriarch of the Western monks, born at Norcia in Central Italy (A.D. 480). In early youth he retired into a cave in the mountains of Subiaco near Rome, where, clothed with the religious habit, fed and instructed by Saint Romanus, a Solitary of the vicinity, he led a hermit’s life. After three years of solitude, he built monasteries for the numerous disciples that had gathered round him. In the year 529 he left Subiaco for Monte Cassino, on the road to Naples, and there founded the great Abbey of that name. Saint Gregory the Great, who wrote the Life of Saint Benedict, mentions also a monastery of nuns presided over by the Saint’s sister, Saint Scholastica. The Rule written by Saint Benedict, in the course of a hundred years or so, was accepted by all the Western monks. It shows the way to religious perfection by the practice of humility, obedience, prayer, silence and retirement from the concerns of the world. Saint Benedict died (A.D. 543), standing before the Altar, immediately after having received Holy Communion.”</i> (Based on the Ramsgate Book of Saints)

Jerome, Cyril, Ephrem, Augustine) say that the consent of Mary was essential to the redemption. It was the will of God, St. Thomas says (Summa III:30), that the redemption of mankind should depend upon the consent of the Virgin Mary. This does not mean that God in His plans was bound by the will of a creature, and that man would not have been redeemed, if Mary had not consented. It only means that the consent of Mary was foreseen from all eternity, and therefore was received as essential into the design of God.”</i> (Based on the Catholic Encyclopedia)
